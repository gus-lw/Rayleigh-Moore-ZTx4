# Rayleigh-Moore-ZTx4
Rayleigh-Moore Analysis for circadian parameter measured each 4 hours

This Excel file aimed to apply Rayleigh-Moore vectorial test (http://www.jstor.org/stable/2335330) to data set collected across 24 hours sleep/wake cycle. 
The datasheet is designed to fit with 6 groups experiments corresponding to ZT-0 (time when lighs are switched on), ZT-4, ZT-8, ZT-12 (time when lights are switched off), ZT-1- and ZT-20 (ZT: Zeitgeber Time).
Two sheets named DAT1 and DATA2 are available. On each, one inputs his data in the blue area labelled 'Data set'. The P-Value refers to the P-value of the h0 hypothesis: N vectors have circular uniform distribution.
The 1st harmonic looks for a main 'pic', that stand for a main préférential circular orietation of vectors. The 2nd harmonic looks for any smeller 'pic'.

Finally, by inputing data in DATA1 and DATA2 sheets, one could calculates the phase delay in hours between the two circadian signals (looking at th 'Delay (h)' cell in DATA2 sheet).


By default both Excel sheets are lock, if one needs to unlock it, the password is 123.
